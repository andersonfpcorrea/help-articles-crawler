### **Viasat's Unlimited Data service plans do not have a monthly data allowance.**

**Q What happens when I reach the amount of data listed on my ****Unlimited Data Plan**  
**A** After exceeding the data usage threshold for your service plan during your monthly measurement period, Viasat may prioritize your data behind other customers during network congestion, resulting in slower speeds.   
  
**Q ****How do I know how much data I have used? **  
**A** Customers on Unlimited Plans will receive a data usage notification email when 100% of your High-Speed Data has been used. 

* To see how much High-Speed Data is available on your plan, go to [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/), and there you will see your current usage along with your plan's allotted allowance of High-Speed Data.

* Check out this article, [How to check your data usage - quick and easy options](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-check-your-data-usage-quick-and-easy-options).

* After you exceed your Unlimited data plan's High-Speed Data, you still have Unlimited Standard Data. Learn how to buy more High-Speed data for your Unlimited plan. Check out this article, [New! Add more High-Speed data to your Unlimited plan](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/New-Unlimited-Data-plan-buy-more-option).

* No matter how much Standard Data you use, you do not need to worry about being cut off or automatically charged. However, Standard Data may be slower when the network is congested. 

  
**Q****What's the difference between Unlimited Standard Data and High-Speed Data?**  
**A** If you are on a Choice or Unlimited data plan, your plan already comes with Unlimited Standard Data and a set amount of High-Speed Data.

**With Unlimited Standard Data:**

* You can do essential internet activities like web browsing, email, social media, and audio streaming.

* No matter how much Standard Data you use each month, you'll never be cut off or charged more than your plan's monthly cost. 

**With High-Speed Data:**

* High-Speed data delivers the internet at your plan's advertised speeds.

* If you run out of High-Speed Data, you will continue to receive unlimited access to Standard Data which may result in slower speeds.

**Note: **Most plans have the feature to purchase more High-Speed Data using Data Boost in [My Viasat](https://my.viasat.com/) or you can use the [My Viasat Mobile App](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/Manage-your-service-with-the-MyViasat-Mobile-App) and select the appropriate Data Boost bundle option that best fits your needs.

**Q If I'm an existing customer and out of my contract, do I need to sign a new contract if I change to an Unlimited Data or Choice Plan?**  
**A **If you have an SB2 (no WiFi) or SB2+ (WiFi) modem, you can change to an Unlimited Plan without signing a new customer agreement! Check out this article to learn more, [How to Change Your Plan](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-Change-Your-Plan). 

  
**Q Do you reset the measurement of my data usage each month?**  
**A** Yes. Each month, your data usage resets to zero on the date your bill is due. You can find your reset date by going to [My Viasat](https://my.viasat.com/) and logging into your customer portal. 

* If you buy more Data Boost for High-Speed Data any time during the month, it will reset on the first day of each new billing cycle.

* All additional Data Boost purchases will expire on your bill cycle date, so it's important that you use any data you've purchased before it expires. Unused High-Speed Data does not roll over.

  
**Q What will the viewing quality be like on the Unlimited Data Plans?**  
**A** To answer this question, we want to ensure you are on the package that will benefit you the most. Your answers to the following questions will help guide you to understanding the needs of your household: 

* If you feel you are a high data user, consider what type of devices you connect to the Internet and what video quality you prefer.

* Consider the questions below to determine what unlimited plan could be right for you. 

  * **How important is video quality for you? **

    * If it is crucial, you may be a candidate for Gold 30. 

    * If it is not essential, you may be a candidate for Bronze 12.

  * **What devices do you use to watch a video (smartphone, laptop, large TVs)?**

    * Match your answer with the plan (i.e., If smartphone - Bronze 12 may be a good choice).

      * TV screen size ranges:

        * 28 - 42 inches (71 - 107cm) - Small

        * 42 - 55 inches (107 - 140cm) - Medium

        * 60+ inches (150+ cm) - Large
  * 
**How much monthly streaming (movies, music, etc.) do you do?**

    * If the answer is a low number (i.e., 5GB), maybe an Unlimited Plan is not the right fit.

**Q Why do my speeds vary at times when I haven't used much data at all?**  
**A** Two reasons:

1. You will receive the median up to speed on your service plan. You should expect half the time you see speeds that are faster than your service plan speed and half the time speeds that are slower than your service plan speed.

2. The speed of the internet service may vary due to, among other factors, network or Internet congestion, the number of users in a household at a particular time, the caliber of in-home networking connections, computer performance (including the presence of viruses or malware), the limitations of different devices (such as a smartphone versus a desktop computer) and weather.

  
**Q What else should I be aware of when considering an Unlimited Data plan?**  
**A** Internet speeds are "up to," will vary, and are not guaranteed.

1. Video streaming is at (LD, DVD, or HD) quality (typically up to 360, 480, 720, or 1080p).

2. Streaming Video Quality is "up to," will vary, and is not guaranteed.

3. Some people use VPN connections to work from home, and some remote computer access software may be very slow. Some VPNs may not work at all.

4. Some games' performance over the Internet is very poor, and some games may not work.

  
**Q ****Can I purchase more High-Speed Data if I go over my data usage threshold during my monthly billing period?**  
**A** Yes! Most Unlimited plans have the option to buy more High-Speed data using Data Boost. Please check [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/) to see if this option is available for your plan. 

**Buy 5 GB of data boost for $9.99**

* 5 GBs will stream approximately three average movies at DVD quality (typically 480p) on phones, tablets, laptops, and small-screen TVs. Click [here](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/New-Unlimited-Data-plan-buy-more-option) to learn more.

**Buy 80 GB of data boost for $99.99**  
  
Viasat's Unlimited Data internet plans come with a set amount of High-Speed Data. If you run out of High-Speed Data, you will continue to receive unlimited access to Standard Data which may result in slower speeds. Most plans have the feature to buy more data in [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/).

* The additional purchase of High-Speed Data using Data Boost will be charged to your payment method on file and appear on your next invoice. All additional High-Speed Data purchases will expire on your bill cycle date, so you must use them up!

  
**Q ****What happens to my ****Unlimited Data Plan****during network congestion?**  
**A** Generally, when the network is congested (i.e., busy), all customers will receive slower internet speeds. Web pages and videos may respond and load more slowly than during periods of non-congestion. If you have used more than your monthly data usage threshold and the network is congested, your speeds will be even slower. 

* Further, during network congestion, customers on the Bronze 12, Silver 25, and Gold 30 service plans, who purchased their service plans before February 13, 2018, may be prioritized behind other customers who have not exceeded their data allowance or usage threshold regardless of the amount of data used, resulting in slower speeds. 

* Please see [Viasat's Network Management Policy](https://www.viasat.com/legal/) for full details on Viasat's network management policies.

  
**Q: May I use the data I receive through my ****Unlimited Data Plan ****for business purposes?**  
**A** No, other than for home office purposes. 

* The service is for personal and non-commercial use only. It must be used solely in your residence and not in any commercial, retail, or business location (other than a home office).
