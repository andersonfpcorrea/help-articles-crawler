**We use auto payment - there will be no paper bill.**

* You will not receive a bill or statement in the mail. Everything is done online.

* That means we need an electronic payment option from you on file. That can be a credit or debit card charge or electronic funds transfer from your bank account. Click [here](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/Payment-methods-you-can-use-for-Viasat-Internet-service) to learn more.

* We'll let you know if there's a glitch with your auto payment. Click [here](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/emails-I-can-expect-from-Viasat) to learn more.

* When you need to make a quick one-time payment, you can use our EasyPay feature: [Make a quick one-time payment with EasyPay](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-make-a-one-time-payment-through-My-Viasat?language=en_US&r=80&ui-knowledge-components-aura-actions.KnowledgeArticleVersionCreateDraftFromOnlineAction.createDraftFromOnlineArticle=1). **Note:** If you pay over the phone with an agent, an assistance fee of $5.00 will be added to your following statement.

  
**We bill a month in advance.**

* Viasat always bills for service one month in advance. 

* Viasat is a paperless company, and your payment method is charged on the same date every month. You will receive monthly emails with bill details, and you can always review your monthly charges and payment due date at [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/).

* Ten days before your payment is due, you'll receive an email reminder that your payment due date is approaching. Then, you'll receive an email from us on the date your payment is processed with information about your current charges. Click here to see other emails Viasat may send you related to your account.

**Your first billing statement will be slightly different from the rest.**

Your first statement will be emailed at the start of your bill cycle date, usually within 4-days of your installation. This is typically larger than your future monthly bills because it includes the charge for

* Your first whole month of service
* The first few days of service before the billing date
* Plus any one-time fees, if applicable, related to your setup and installation

Your payment will process 10-days after you receive your statement, using your payment method on file. You can always review your monthly charges and payment date at [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/). Be sure to read, [How to read and understand your billing statement](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-understand-your-bill?language=en_US&r=80&ui-knowledge-components-aura-actions.KnowledgeArticleVersionCreateDraftFromOnlineAction.createDraftFromOnlineArticle=1).   
  
  
**The Viasat Standard 24-month Service Agreement**

If you disconnect before the end of the 24-month service agreement, you may be charged fees for early termination. 

* These fees are $15 for every month remaining in the minimum service term. 

* For example, if you canceled service 20 months into the 24-month minimum service term, you would pay $15 a month for the four unfulfilled months, or $60.

* Signing your customer agreement takes place right after installation while the technician is in your home.
