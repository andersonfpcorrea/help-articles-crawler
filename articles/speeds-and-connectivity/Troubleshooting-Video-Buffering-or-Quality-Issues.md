### **Check how your current Plan is associated with your video stream quality.**

Unlimited plans don't have hard data caps, but they have data usage thresholds. After using the High-Speed Data for your specific Plan, speeds may prioritize behind other customers during busy network times (usually in the evenings).   
  
To view a chart with data usage thresholds, [click here](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/FAQ-s-Viasat-Unlimited-Plans).  
  
Each Plan has a set amount of High-Speed data, which delivers the internet at your Plan's advertised speeds. Once this data is used, you will still have Standard data. With Standard data, you can do your everyday essential internet activities like web browsing, email, social media, and audio streaming.  

**The following steps will help determine the possible cause for video quality or buffering issues: **

Is there inclement weather affecting the gateway your service is connected to?

Your service may have a weather outage on rare occasions even though you see clear skies. Your service is also associated with a large hub - a gateway - far from your house. In many cases, it can be in another state.  
  
Weather outages are rarer at gateways due to the larger antennas used. However, it is possible. If this happens, the outage would likely be brief. Check out this article to learn how weather affects[my Viasat Internet Service.](https://help.viasat.com/#)

**Is my device connected via Wi-Fi?**

Some streaming devices such as computers or smart TVs can be directly connected to the modem using an ethernet cable. Doing so will eliminate Wi-Fi "noise," which could improve buffering or pausing.

**Have you set the Video Quality Settings on your streaming apps?**

Lower video quality equates to less data pushed through your system. With less data, the system can "stream" video quicker.  
To adjust these settings within specific streaming apps, visit our [Tips for streaming movies and music](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/Tips-for-streaming).
