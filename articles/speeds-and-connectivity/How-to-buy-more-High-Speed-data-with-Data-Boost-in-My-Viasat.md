### **Things to know when buying more High-Speed Data with Data Boost**

* If you've already used all your High-Speed-Data, don't worry. It'll resume normal speed soon after you make your data purchase. 

* This non-refundable purchase will appear on your next bill only.

* Keep in mind any unused additional data will expire and won't carry over to the following month when your bill cycles. 

* You must have a payment method on file to buy more data.
