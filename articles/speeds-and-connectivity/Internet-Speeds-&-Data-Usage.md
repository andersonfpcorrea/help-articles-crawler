We understand the importance of having reliable internet access, especially for work, school, and staying connected with others. While we strive to provide our customers with the best Internet speeds possible, there are steps you can take at home to help maximize your internet speeds when you need it the most. 

**Here are some tips to maximize your Internet speeds: **

1. **Monitor your data usage**: Most Viasat Internet plans include a set amount of High-Speed Data, and one common reason for slow speeds is exceeding your allowance. You can keep track of your usage in [My Viasat.](https://my.viasat.com/PlanUsage) You will also receive email notifications at 70%, 90%, and 100% of your data allowance (Liberty plans will only receive the 100% notification). 

1. **Manually [set the video quality](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-Optimize-Video-Streaming-Settings-to-Save-High-Speed-Data) on streaming platforms**: Streaming can cause high rates of data consumption. By lowering the video quality on your streaming app, you can reduce the amount of High-Speed Data your device uses while streaming. This can help you make the most of your High-Speed Data allowance and enjoy more hours of streaming without worrying about running out of High-Speed Data. 

1. **Optimize your Wi-Fi coverage**: Poor Wi-Fi coverage can lead to slow speeds. Place your router in a central and open location within your home to ensure better coverage. Consider using a [recommended speed test](https://forum.viasat.com/t/how-to-run-a-speed-test-from-my-modem/47) that can help you differentiate between Wi-Fi-related slowness and issues with your Viasat connection.

Our engineers can assist you in identifying and resolving speed issues, such as mis-pointed antennas, cabling problems, or hardware issues. 

1. **Purchase additional data**: If you're running out of priority data, you can buy more through [My Viasat](http://my.viasat.com/) to avoid slower speeds. 

By monitoring data usage, adjusting video quality, optimizing Wi-Fi coverage, troubleshooting speed issues, and purchasing additional data when needed, you can maximize your internet speeds and help create a seamless online experience.
