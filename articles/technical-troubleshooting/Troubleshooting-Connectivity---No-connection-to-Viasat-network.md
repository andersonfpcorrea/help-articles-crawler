### **Is your Internet down?   
Let's get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible!**

There are several reasons for not getting any internet signal at all, and they range from a network outage on our end to computer and router problems on your end. Let's get started.  
  
**Are you on an unlimited data plan?**  
Unlimited plans don't have hard data caps, but they do have data thresholds. If you have reached the data threshold for your specific unlimited plan, your speeds may be prioritized behind other customers during busy network times (usually in the evenings). If your connection issues seem to happen in the evenings, it may not be a connection issue at all. **Help is here! **

**Are you on a data-capped plan?**  
If you're on a capped data plan and ​​​​you've exceeded your monthly data allowance, your service could be slowed or restricted, appearing to be a connection problem.

* If that's the case, you can purchase more High-Speed Data or wait for your new billing cycle to begin. [How to buy more data with My Viasat](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/Buy-More-High-Speed-Data)

**Restart your system by rebooting the modem**

* If you have a WiFi Modem where the router and modem are one unit, you only have to worry about unplugging that device.

* Otherwise, connect the modem directly to your computer with an Ethernet cable. Is internet service working?

  * Yes

    * Then the problem most likely lies with the WiFi router.

      * If it's the router, the manufacturer is your best resource if you're having trouble.

      * Whether it's Netgear, Linksys, D-Link, or another manufacturer, most router manufacturers provide good support on their websites. They typically offer free phone support for a limited time with new routers. 

  * No
    * Reconnect the router and continue with the following troubleshooting steps.

  
**Run a modem diagnostics test**

The My Viasat Mobile app can easily and quickly run a diagnostics test on your modem; you need to download the app, select Help, and then Run Diagnostics.

**Do a weather check**

* Heavy thunder or snowstorms can affect service, although it's usually for a brief period.

* Keep in mind that the internet ground station antenna that serves your location may be in another part of the country, so whether there could impact service even if it's clear where you are
