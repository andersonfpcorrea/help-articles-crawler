### **Wireless, whole-house Viasat Internet service can be set up for a minimal investment.**

**A home network allows you to tap into the internet anywhere in your home, on various devices — without the use of cumbersome cables. **

  
**Step 1**  
**First, you need a router.**

1. If you have a Viasat WiFi Modem, a router is integrated into the device. You can also use one of the four ports on the Viasat _Wi-Fi_ Modem to attach an additional router.

2. Otherwise, purchase a wireless router. They're available at most general retailers – from Best Buy to Target – and range from about $30 to $200. 
3. If you want to extend the Wi-Fi signal's reach, consider purchasing a wireless range extender product and connecting that device to your Wi-Fi modem.

4. Regarding which modem to buy—any modern router will work well with Viasat. 

**What to consider when purchasing a router? **

* At the high end, you'll get better video-streaming, greater range, and enhanced security features. A higher-end router may also ensure the seamless connection of multiple devices. 

* Think about the number of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and printers you'll need to connect and choose from there.

**Step 2**  
**Setting up the router**

* The router easily connects to the modem provided by Viasat with your service. 

* The router, in turn, taps into the modem. This link creates a wireless Wi-Fi network that shares the modem's signal with your other devices. 

* All you need to connect your smartphone, tablet and other electronic devices to the network is a password.

* If you want to use a non-Viasat router, connect the wireless router to one of the four Ethernet ports on the Wi-Fi modem.

**Some of our modems have built-in Wi-Fi**.  
Here are some examples of how you can set up our different modems:

**Step 3  
Now let's get your wireless network set up.**

1. If you're replacing or upgrading an older router, completely disconnect it before installing your new router.

2. Using an Ethernet cable, usually provided with a router, connect the Viasat modem to the internet (or 'WAN') port of the router.

3. Turn on your modem, then the router.

4. Configure your security settings. 

  * You'll do this by typing in a web address (URL), log-in, and password provided in the setup instructions or on the router itself. (The URL address is typically [http://192.168](http://192.0.0.168/)).

  * Most routers have a user-friendly setup program that will walk you through the steps, and you can select different security levels. In addition to a password, you can rename your network (called a "service set" — or "SSID") however you'd like and choose whether to broadcast it so others can see it or not.

5. Test the connection by typing in any website address you'd like to confirm if it connects to the website.

**Note:** This is a general overview; be sure to follow the instructions that come with your router.  
  
**An important point about routers**

* While routers are great at allowing multiple devices to access the internet, be aware that they are all still sharing a single internet connection. 

* So, the more devices using the router at the same time, the less available bandwidth (speed) you'll have at any moment in time.

* You'll likely see data usage increase as you add more devices to your network, so keep an eye on the number of devices on your network, as well as your usage and whether you are on the right plan for your needs. 

**Each router has its own Service Set Identifier (SSID)**

* The SSID is the name of your wireless network.
* You may want to hide the SSID of the router you don't plan to use
  * For instance, you could hide the Viasat router's SSID and keep the external router's SSID visible. This will eliminate any confusion when selecting which SSID to connect to when you view your device's available networks.
* Read [How to change your WiFi Modem or WiFi Gateway network password](https://help.viasat.com/s/article/How-to-change-your-WiFi-Modem-or-WiFi-Gateway-network-password) for more information on changing your SSID.

**Step 4**  
**Be secure: Add a password.**

Passwords are optional but well worth the minimal effort. Choose a secure one, and you'll never have to worry about a neighbor or someone in the range of your wireless router piggy-backing on your network and slowing things down — or worse yet, trying to access personal info. 

  
**Detecting a potential router problem**

* If your internet service ever hiccups, check first that your Viasat Internet signal is good by hooking the modem directly up to your computer with an Ethernet cable. 

* If you still have service that way, the culprit probably is the router.

* Try restarting it (see "Network Restart" below). If that doesn't work, contact the router manufacturer. 

**Step 5**  
**Network Restart**

Here's the correct way to restart your wireless router and Viasat modem (and yes, the order really does make a difference!)

1. Power down the computer connected to your Viasat modem.

2. Unplug the router.

3. Unplug the modem from the electrical outlet.

4. Disconnect the Ethernet cable connecting your computer to the modem.

5. Make sure the Ethernet cable from the router is plugged into the back of the modem. 

6. Plugin the modem. Wait until all LED lights on the modem are solid blue. 

7. Power up the router

8. Power up the computer.

**Note:** Wireless routers do not require a cable connection to the computers they support.
