### **Guidelines for playing video games on Viasat Internet**

**First, the basics: Which video games to play on satellite internet depends on**

1. Your gaming system

2. Physical location

3. Personal preference

4. Ping or latency (the amount of time it takes your input to reach the game's servers).

  
**Next, we can offer some guidelines**

1. Overall, mobile is the best platform for gaming over satellite internet. This is because mobile games are usually less data-intensive and more tolerant of latency.

2. Besides mobile, no platform is inherently better or worse for gaming with satellite â€“ it's more about what you're _doing_ with any given system. Our customers successfully game on PC, Apple, Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox platforms.

3. In general, when choosing games, look for ones described with words such as RPG, tactics, strategy, puzzle, casual and similar terms. See the sidebar for more detail on those terms.

4. Use caution with games described with words like PvP, first-person shooter, massively multiplayer, or real-time action. These are more sensitive to the higher latency seen in satellite internet. See the sidebar for more information.

5. Look for game modes, groups, and activities that don't require a super-fast ping. This could mean opting for a support role in a multiplayer game, only connecting your game world to other players' worlds occasionally, or choosing solo modes in online games.

6. Remember that downloading and playing _any_ game will use up some amount of data on your plan. Most games will also periodically try to update themselves if you let them. It's important to do your research and make sure you're OK with the amount of data your game of choice will use. 

  
**Here's an idea of what to expect from some popular games on Viasat Internet **  
  
**Works well** (They should work pretty well)

* **Angry Birds, Plants vs. Zombies, Candy Crush**: If you enjoy mobile games, the satellite should be able to handle your connection needs.

* **Animal Crossing: New Horizons:** This Nintendo Switch game is an example of a game where the multiplayer elements play fairly well with satellite internet. But stay aware of who you or your kid is connecting with and when.

* **Call of Duty Mobile, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile: **Note the "mobile." If you want to play big-name shooters over satellite internet, the mobile versions are your best bet.

* **Clash Royale**

* **Civilization VI**

* **Farmville**

* **Hearthstone**

* **Marvel Contest of Champions**

* **Minecraft:** While you may encounter occasional lag, some older games such as Minecraft were made to accommodate the slow broadband connections of years ago and don't require lightning-fast ping. 

* **[Miniclip.com](http://miniclip.com/) and other browser-based games sites:** Browser-based games tend to be a great choice for satellite internet, both in technical requirements and the data used. Just make sure you're visiting reputable sites!

* **Pokemon Go/Harry Potter Wizards Unite: **Now that we're spending more time hunting for Charizard in our own backyards, connecting your phone to Wi-Fi is a great way to save data on your cellphone plan. And since mobile augmented reality games such as Harry Potter and Pokemon Go only use about 3-5 MB of data per hour, it's a pretty manageable way to the game.

* **Roblox: **Some games on Roblox may work well with satellite internet, like single-player or role-play games. Others, like PvP or first-person shooters may be more sensitive to the higher latency seen in satellite internet.

* **Second Life**

* **The Sims**

* **Subway Surfers**

* **Words with Friends**

  
**Maybe **(They may be playable with some hitches in performance or functionality)

* **World of Warcraft:** WoW is designed to support a range of internet connections. Your experience might not be perfect, but many players have reported playing with decent success.

* **Grand Theft Auto Online, Fallout 76: **These games are good examples of the balance each player will have to strike when playing newish multiplayer games over satellite. Are you willing to burn some data ([about 60 MB or more per hour](https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/Guides/how-much-data-do-I-need-for-online-gaming)) and adjust your expectations a bit to play recent big-name games? If so, there's a good chance you can find a sweet spot here.

* **League of Legends**: If you're interested in playing LoL or similar games over satellite, you should consider how competitive you want to be. Satellite may work out for players just looking to have some fun. But if you or your teammates are seriously looking to climb the ranks, you may become frustrated.

* **Madden football, FIFA soccer:** You should be able to play solo and against others in your home, but online multiplayer will likely be a very rough experience.__This is probably the case with most fast-paced online sports games.  

**Not recommended** (You're likely to run into noticeable problems playing the game over satellite internet - or won't be able to play at all).

* **Fortnite, Overwatch, Call of Duty, PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds, Counterstrike Global Offensive:** Big-name, high-player count online shooters are generally not a good match for satellite internet. If your game of choice offers a mobile version, you will probably have better luck there.
* **Street Fighter 5, Mortal Kombat 11:** You should be able to enjoy fighting games at home, but online fights are likely to be very frustrating for both you and your opponent. In some cases, you may not be allowed to compete online at all.

* **Rocket League**

* **Dota 2**
