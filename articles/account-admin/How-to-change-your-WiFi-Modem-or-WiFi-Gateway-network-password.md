When prompted, log in using the credentials below:

* For the WiFi Modem (SB2+):

  * Username: admin

  * Password: admin

* For the Viasat Wireless Gateway (VWG):

**To access the modem interface.**

* Type [**192.168.100.1**](http://192.168.100.1/) in your browser URL bar

* Enter your modem user name and password. If you have not previously created your own user name and password, the modem****credentials are:

  * Username: admin

  * Password: Use the Admin Password or Key from the sticker on the bottom of the modem

* Click the Sign In button.

**​Your network name is what people will see.**

* And, the password is what they would log into to gain access to your network.

* This is possible when they look for wireless networks within their device range, so keeping your router secure with a strong password is important to keep unwanted users off your network and consuming your data.

* More users on your network can also slow your internet speeds down. 

* ​If you want an even higher security level, you can change the SSID broadcast to "Private," which will then hide your network name from the list of available networks within range. However, if you choose to make it private, you will not see it in the list of available networks either.

* You may also consider setting up a guest network with a separate password to share with visitors, non-family members, and others you'd prefer not to have potential access to your personal online information.
